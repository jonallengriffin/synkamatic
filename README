Synkamatic helps to automate the syncing of changes between mirrored Mozilla hg and github repos

== How it Works ==

Synkamatic is a semi-automatic bridge between subsets of the mozilla-central
mercurial repository, http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central, and related
projects on github, https://github.com/ .

Synkamatic listens to messages using mozillapulse.

== Reference ==

Github pull requests: http://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/

Python github client library: https://github.com/ask/python-github2 (for version 2, github is up to version 3)

There's a github API v3 lib at http://vincent-jacques.net/PyGithub.
